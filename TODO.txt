BUGS

 - miner pakte 32 carpet ni goed?

----------------------------------------
HAPPINESS

V unhappiness from amount of employed villagers (exponential?)
V unhappiness from hunger

V happiness from special items in room (similar to buildingrequirements)
V happiness from special resources (chicken, ...)
V happiness from amount of unemployed villagers

=> 

V happiness modifies waiting times of villagers
V		=> also walking speed
- influences how fast new immigrants come (?)
- (gives extra faction power)


----------------------------------------

 - Fix metadata! load/save! ( use my own map instead? )

 - Trade villager becomes invalid if his chunk gets unloaded, disappears when u trade with him and only respawn if u recheck.. he needs to repsawn when u load chunk or something..

 - Fix villagers buggens als chunks niet loaded zijn ofzo

- unemployeds wait a bit longer before getting food
 => check waiting mechanisms: timings when everyone gets food

- no villager spawning when town hall inactive !! what should happen when townhall inactive??

- only stairs down and up when checking paths

- Villager paper lore adden: productions

- tweek consumption & production

- make inventories able to use durability > ink sacks = durability of bone meal... (?)
- check ALL TODO's

- implement possibility to give tools to citizens (but how?)

------------------+---------------------------------------------------------
s m a l l  things :
------------------+


- happiness overview in Statistics Book
- number of unemployeds in book as well

- Make starting tools wooden

- Fix abuse hole: als een job langer duurt dan sleepWaitingTime, skipt ie slaap en ontbijt!

- give MAX_AIRSPACE variable to each building (instead of only the BuildingRequirement)
  so that the airspace checker can already stop when airspace is biggar than that max, instead of the 8000!

- BUGGY shit: when server crashes, metadata might revert to older state while cities are stored in json
	==> recheck metadata! (or recheck buildings?)

- remove bug of getting stuck when door to warehouse is next to chest! (?)

- recheck metadata of blocks when it matters (for example when it would stop mining)
- remove belongingTo metadata when improper!

- send message when buildings become active (just like when they become inactive)

- flowing water problem
  let water destroy rails/carpet?
    then they really avoid water maybe...

- statistics production and consumption separate

- remove iron golem spawning?

- bug: when there is only one bread left, they dont take it but register it as being consumed?!!?!?!?!?

- bij het slapen gaan controleren of er genoeg shit is voor de consumption vd volgende dag! => msg to whole faction

-----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------
D E S I G N  questions :
-----------------------+

- multiple storage rooms and multiple mines!
  => boys zoeken dichstbijzijnde

- separate food 
  > always eat (also when there's no job)

- make seperate limit for number of path tiles checked

- turn off faction claiming in nether / end (?) (or revise city.world field to city.universe ?)

- alter the achievements (kan dat ?)

- slower walking of villagers?

--------------+

- make rails 'fake' => non-dropping >> also when block below falls

- closeAirSpaceChecker: fix that the metadata next to a railblock or next to the block above a rail block does get set to belonging to the building
  ==> dont just make the block above rail solid?
  ==> maybe instead use a railblock with an open trapdoor above it?

- fix grading

- check all TODO's in Miner and in MineUtils!


---- maybe:

- fix actual stairs for stairs...


- now we stop mining when we have mined 20 blocks (or so) and when resources get low
  => introduce other stopping conditions!
    - when # tracks have been put down
    - when inventory space gets low

- have a small chance to just create a new path from a straight path...
